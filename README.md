### KEY INSIGHTS:

1.  Admission rates were very consistent (between 49 - 50 %)
2.  Satisfaction dipped slightly in 2023, while wait times rose year-on-year
3.  Elderly patients (60+) are increasing while younger groups declined. 
4.  Patients distribution across days and quarters became more balanced in 2023 citing better scheduling 

### SUMMARY
1.  Between 2021–2023, healthcare activity was steady, with small fluctuations in patient numbers and admission rates. However, the following was observed:
2.  Rising wait times and the decline in satisfaction in 2023 suggest mild strain on service delivery. 
3.  The most notable demographic trend is the steady growth in elderly patients, requiring more focused care. 
4.  Operationally, patient demand evened out across days and quarters in 2023, which may reflect better scheduling or consistent service use. Data tracking gaps remain in         referral sources and racial identification.


### Recommendations
1.  Reduce Wait Times: Streamline patient flow and review staffing to prevent further increases.
2.  Strengthen Eldercare: Expand healthcare services for old people to meet the growing 60+ demand.
3.  Improve Data Capture: Minimize  “Declined to Identify” in race to strengthen reporting.
4.  Optimize Scheduling: Continue leveraging the balanced demand across quarters and weekdays to allocate resources more efficiently.
